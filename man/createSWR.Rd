\arguments{
\item{...}{further variables to be appended to the \code{SWR} model object}

\description{
Constructor to create an \code{SWR} model object manually based on model parameters
}
\details{
An \code{SWR} model object is an S3-class object, which contains at least two variables:
\itemize{
\item a matrix \code{param} with 2 columns representing one window per row. The first column contains location parameters delta (>=0), the second column contains the standard deviation sigma (>0),
\item a vector \code{beta} of regression parameters, representing one window each.
Thus, the number of windows is given by the number of rows in \code{param}, as well as by the number of elements in \code{beta}.
Additional variables can be appended to the \code{SWR} model object by using the \code{...} argument
}
}
